## Why?

Over the past few months I've come to appreciate using a design/style guide in my projects and have spent considerable time evaluating modern CSS solutions and for now, have settled on [`glamorous`](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous).  With this in mind, my goals for this repo are:

- enable the consumer of this module to build **complex**, **responsive** views by composing together the relatively simple components provided here
- **reduce repetition** by making these components reusable and able to be styled dynamically
- a single page to be used as a bare bones style guide, for quick, distraction-free reference (a minimal [`storybook`](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook))

## TODO

- [ ] Decide on API for passing style props
- [ ] release `propStyles` utility as a separate package

## Dependencies

- [`glamor`](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor)
- [`glamorous`](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous)

## Installation

```

## Usage
